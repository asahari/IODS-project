#Chapter 1

R Studio and R were already installed at the beginning of this course. I did have to update the databases running a command from R but otherwise everything seems to work out fine. Git was ok and GitHub Desktop presented no difficulties or surprising obstacles. We'll have to see about the commit though!

Went through the tasks. This is fun actually! Even if I only have a faint idea of what I'm doing though.
